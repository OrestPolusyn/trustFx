    The formation of the company began back in 2005, when the possibilities by brokers of transferring funds to
    individuals
    were very limited, and this kind of service was not particularly popular. Anthony Barnes founded the company, which
    was
    later dubbed TRADERS UNITED SYSTEM FOREX LIMITED.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have been working quite successfully in the financial services market for more than fifteen years, and during
    that
    time, succeeded in many ways. Thus, the company is constantly expanding the range of instruments we work with. Over
    the
    past few years, dozens of professional traders have joined our ranks, they have been working in the stock and
    cryptocurrency markets for a long time. This made it possible to achieve a significant increase in the efficiency
    and
    profitability of TrustFX, which had a positive effect on the wealth of our investors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our staff uses modern instruments of situational control in the private investment market; this allows us to
    determine
    possible problems and hidden pitfalls well in advance and take the steps necessary to avoid them with minimal
    losses. In
    the last year, we successfully provided our investors with a profit sized at X% of the investment amount. This
    speaks
    very highly about our professionalism and accountability.Based on our wealth of experience, we can guarantee not
    only
    lucrative returns for each of our investors, but also profit, by reducing the likelihood of risk to the minimum
    possible
    level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our company was founded in 2005 when the opportunities for transferring funds from private parties to the management
    of
    a broker were extremely limited and services similar to this were not too popular. The enterprise, which later
    received
    the name “TRADERS UNITED SYSTEM FOREX LIMITED”, was founded by a person named Anthony Barnes. Still today he stands
    at
    the helm. In part, thanks to his experience, skills, and knowledge, our investors have a stable revenue and
    certainty in
    the future

  <blockquote>
    The business activities of our company were initially based on the principle of a transparent relationship with our
    investors. Thus far, following ten years of business activities, this principle is still pertinent. This principle
    was
    specifically chosen to be the foundation. Allowing our investors to see how their investments are being used, we
    increase the level of trust between us and our investors and give them peace regarding the return and profit on
    their
    investment.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Our organization, during the course of ten years of activities, has kept its independence. Nonetheless, we still
    invest
    a lot of resources into perfecting the technology and instruments used to guarantee a high level of quality in our
    provided services. For example, in 2015, our company launched an investment platform which allows everyone to
    receive a
    passive income, regardless of the amount of their investment.

  </p>

  <p>
    “TRUST-FX” is a sensible, effective, and completely transparent manager of the investments of every investor.
